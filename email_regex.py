# All we are really doing is comparing the input string to one
# gigantic regular expression.  But building that regexp, and
# ensuring its correctness, is made much easier by assembling it
# from the "tokens" defined by the RFC.  Each of these tokens is
# tested in the accompanying unit test file.
#
# The section of RFC 2822 from which each pattern component is
# derived is given in an accompanying comment.
#
# (To make things simple, every string below is given as 'raw',
# even when it's not strictly necessary.  This way we don't forget
# when it is necessary.)
